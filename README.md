## Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected me to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose me to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. I’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

## Instructions

The steps for this assignment are divided into the following subsections:

1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

4. Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain
